- Need the Python 2.7 friendly version of the code
- Currently the code does not check if the robot program running or not. It just sends the command to the robot. 
    So, if the robot program is running, the remainig previous programs will be lost and the new commands will be executed. 
    Need to check if the robot program is running or not before sending the command.
